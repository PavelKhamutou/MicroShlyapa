Hello
THIS IS TEST CASE $3, ops #3!

Here i'm going to test some errors:
    1) I will create 3 definitions, but call only 2 of them.
    2) In one macro call, i will put less parameters then required and in 2nd more then required.
    3) Redefine macros.
    4) I will call not declared macros. &





hey! Pavel how are you  doing fine?  right?

now with less then required:
hey! Chip how are you   fine?  




 we are the  best

now with more then required:

 we  much the  more
 we  can think the  best

calling not declated macros:






redefinition:



I am redefined!
