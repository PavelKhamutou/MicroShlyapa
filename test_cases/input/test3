Hello
THIS IS TEST CASE $3, ops #3!

Here i'm going to test some errors:
    1) I will create 3 definitions, but call only 2 of them.
    2) In one macro call, i will put less parameters then required and in 2nd more then required.
    3) Redefine macros.
    4) I will call not declared macros. &



#MACRO_1(&1, &2, &3){hey! &1 how are you &2 fine? &3}

$MACRO_1(Pavel, doing, right?)

now with less then required:
$MACRO_1(Chip)


#MACRO_2(&1, &2){ we &1 the &2}

$MACRO_2(are, best)

now with more then required:

$MACRO_2(are, best, much, more)
$MACRO_2(are, best, much, more, then, you, can think)

calling not declated macros:

$ImNotDeclared( cool, right?)

#macro_3(&1){ never use &1}


redefinition:

#MACRO_2(&1)
{I am &1}

$MACRO_2(redefined!)
